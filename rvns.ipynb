    "# Random Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS) for Hub Location\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to implement and analyze the Random Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS) algorithm for solving the Uncapacitated Single Allocation p-Hub Median Problem (USApHMP). In the USApHMP, we are given a network with nodes and edges, where each node represents a potential location for a hub. The task is to select p nodes to place the hubs in such a way that the total transportation cost is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RVNS algorithm is a metaheuristic approach that explores different \"neighborhoods\" (i.e., variations) of the current solution, aiming to find improvements. This process is repeated for a specified number of iterations, or until a satisfactory solution is found. The RVNS has two main versions: the RVNS with the first improvement strategy and the RVNS with the best improvement strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RVNS with the first improvement strategy generates a neighboring solution and accepts it if it improves upon the current solution. The process is then repeated from this new solution. If the new solution is not an improvement, a new neighboring solution is generated, and the process continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RVNS with the best improvement strategy, on the other hand, generates all possible neighboring solutions and selects the best among them. If this new solution is better than the current one, it replaces the current solution, and the process repeats.\n"
